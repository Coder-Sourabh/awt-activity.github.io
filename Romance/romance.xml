	<description>You really can't go wrong with any of Jasmine Guillory's fun, romantic romps, but this Reese's Book Club pick is especially great. Freelance writer Nik's boyfriend proposes at a Dodger's game, and the dude can't even spell her name right. She says no (duh), and the video goes viral. Handsome doctor Carlos sweeps her away from the frenzy, but he can't possibly be the real deal. Or can he? </description>

	<description>If you've never read this 900-plus-page Civil War saga (or watched the four-hour movie), it's never too late. Scarlett O'Hara, her "perfect knight" Ashley Wilkes, and the scandalous yet dashing Rhett Butler stand the test of time. Readers have devoured more than 30 million copies of this Pulitzer Prize winner since 1936 and once you dive in, you'll understand why. </description>
